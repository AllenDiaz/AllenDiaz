### 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer specializing in creating **immersive 3D web experiences** and scalable software solutions. With expertise in modern frameworks like **React**, **Next.js**, **Three.js**, and backend technologies like **FastAPI** and **Express**, I transform ideas into interactive digital experiences.

Currently working as a Full Stack Developer Apprentice at **Safeway Albertsons Philtech**, I design system architectures, develop AI-integrated applications, and containerize solutions using Docker. I'm a published researcher with my work featured in **IEEE Xplore**, and I hold multiple certifications from **IBM**, **Meta**, and **Microsoft**.

I believe in the power of continuous learning and creating technology that makes a difference. When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new 3D techniques, contributing to open-source projects, or researching innovative solutions for real-world problems.
